// Given 2 strings as input. Multiply the 2 strings.
/*
 * 125 * 25
 * Idetify which is the bigger string.
 * 125 * 5 first
 * 5 * 5 -> whatever u get % 10 to get the remainder. and the / as the carry.
 * multiply 2 with 5 again the same thing.but add the previous carry this time and get the new carry and mod.
 * follow this step until the end of the first string.
 * 
 * Do the same thing with the next integer 2 but not the result should be multiplied by 10 and added with the previous result.
