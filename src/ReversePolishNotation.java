//Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

/**
 * Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Some examples:
  ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"] -> ((2 + 1) * 3) -> 9
  ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"] -> (4 + (13 / 5)) -> 6
  
  Iterate through the array.
  Add items to the stack. Whenever an operator is found.
  Pop 2 elements from the stack and +/-/multiply/divide them.
  add the result back into the stack.
